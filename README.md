Live updates for NYC's MTA buses

## APIs

Autobus makes use of two public APIs provided by the NYC MTA. 

[One Bus Away API](http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/OneBusAwayRESTfulAPI) - utilized with the mobile device's GPS to pull in a number of nearby bus stops.

[SIRI Standard API](http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/SIRIIntro) - provides real-time data for stop monitoring (what bus routes are served and real-time updates on approaching buses).
